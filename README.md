# Bug Tracker

https://bugtrackerclone-production.up.railway.app/

This is a bug tracker with authentication and a real-time chat. Developed with Python, Flask and Postgres. Deployed on Heroku (migrated to Railway).

The real-time chat was implemented with socket.io.

=> **This web app was created from scratch**.

=> **When I developed this website I mistakenly neglected the different screen sizes. Please zoom-out for better visualization (if necessary).**
